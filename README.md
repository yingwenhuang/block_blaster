		Mathematics is important for our daily life and, and plays a fundamental role in all fields of science. Furthermore, it is a required subject in most levels of education from kindergarten to graduate school. Mathematics contains many different topics such as algebra, geometry, integration, and etc. Some of these topics are difficult for students to master and lead to a decrease in students’ interest in math. Arithmetic is a fundamental skill and is broadly used as an introductory topic in mathematics classes, and is also an important stepping-stone for more advanced mathematics topics, like algebra. Mental math, a method to complete arithmetic in one’s head without any physical supplies likes pens, paper, or calculators, can be a double-edged sword. It can help the students improve their performance in math, or discourage their interest in math. In modern educational systems, some teachers introduce less mental math to their students. Students can struggle to find a learning environment for practicing mental math, and therefore many people become reliable on calculators even for simple arithmetic equations.
